This is the website of the outpatient nursing service in Hannover. 
The idea to create this website is to improve the existing website in wordpress, however, this version was not inspired by the old version in any way but in terms of content and site material.          
My goal to create this website is twofold, educational and commercial, and I tried to meet most expectations in both aspects.

## UX
