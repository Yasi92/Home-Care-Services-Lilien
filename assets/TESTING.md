# Buno Coffee Website - Testing in detils

[Lilien Home Care Services In Action](https://yasi92.github.io/Home-Care-Services-Lilien/)          
[Main README.md file](/README.md)

## Validation

- [W3C Markup Validation]() was used to validate the code in the three HTML files. I tested each page separately, debugged the errors and, in the end, they have all passed with no errors.
- [W3C CSS Validation]() was used to validate the code in my style.css file.
- The website has been tested with the Lighthouse for each page separately and on both desktop and mobile devices and, required actions have been taken to improve the functionality of the website as much as possible and as far as related to HTML and CSS.

| Bugs | Solutions |            
| ----------- | ----------- |
| When testing the published website, noticed that the "scroll-back-to-top" button does not appear after scrolling down the page and its position behaves as if it had an absolute position. The button was not showing on the viewport but it was placed at the bottom of the page instead. | I have fixed this by removing the perspective property from the body element.|
| When testing the HTML files in the w3 validator, I received errors saying that buttons must not appear as a descendant of 'a' elements or vice versa.| I have fixed this by removing the nested structure and instead giving a button class from bootstrap to an 'a' element.|
|When testing the HTML files in the w3 validator, I received warnings regarding empty headings. | I have left this unfixed since the data filling out these empty headings comes from an API using Javascript.|

| I have received a warning from the lighthouse asking to consider a title for the iframe element as screen reader users rely on frame titles to describe the contents of frames. | A title has been added to the element.|
| I have received a warning from the lighthouse asking to consider using a "rel=noopener" attribute for any external links to improve performance and prevent security vulnerabilities.| The intended attribute has been added to all external links.|
| I have received a warning from the lighthouse asking to consider using meta element with unique descriptions and keywords in every page to optimize the search engine machine | This element has been added to every page separately|                                   


## Unfixed Bugs

- In Markup Validation Service, I have disregarded 1 warning regarding considering using h2-h6 elements in the main section on each page, since the heading elements were put separately in the child elements inside each section for semantic reasons and not directly in the section area.

- When testing the CSS file in the w3 validator, I have received a number of warnings and errors from the CSS validator which according to the tutor Fatima from the Code Institute, they are caused by browser compatibility issues related to the external links such as bootstrap. This was not the case when I manually copied and pasted the entire CSS file in the validator.

## Known issues
- In the "About our products" section, the two columns won't line up in iPad Pro and similar-size devices. I know that the overflow of the text area occurs due to the large text area, but due to the importance of the content, I prefer to keep the same amount of text.
In fact, the importance of content has surpassed the importance of ideal design.
